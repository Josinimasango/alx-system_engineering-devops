Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: April 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - April 15, 2024, 2:00 PM
Impact: The outage affected the core web application service, resulting in complete unavailability for approximately 30% of users. Users experienced slow page loading times and intermittent errors during the outage period.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an imbalance in traffic distribution among the application servers.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on application servers and database performance, assuming a potential database bottleneck.
10:30 AM: Database performance was ruled out as the cause. Attention shifted to network-related issues.
11:00 AM: Load balancer logs reviewed, revealing an unusual pattern of traffic distribution.
11:30 AM: Load balancer configuration checked, identifying a misconfigured algorithm leading to uneven traffic distribution.
12:00 PM: Incident escalated to the network operations team for immediate resolution.
1:30 PM: Load balancer configuration corrected to evenly distribute traffic among application servers.
2:00 PM: Service fully restored, and monitoring confirms normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue stemmed from a misconfigured load balancer algorithm, which resulted in uneven distribution of incoming traffic among the application servers. This caused overload on some servers while leaving others underutilized, leading to degraded performance and intermittent errors. The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to evenly distribute traffic among all available servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Immediate Correction: Ensure load balancer configuration settings are accurately configured to evenly distribute traffic among application servers.
Monitoring Enhancement: Implement more comprehensive monitoring for load balancer performance metrics, including traffic distribution and server utilization.
Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to identify and correct any misconfigurations proactively.
Documentation Update: Update documentation regarding load balancer configuration best practices to prevent similar issues in the future.
Conclusion:
The web stack outage was swiftly addressed through prompt detection, thorough investigation, and collaboration between engineering and network operations teams. By implementing corrective measures and enhancing monitoring capabilities, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future, ensuring a more reliable and resilient web infrastructure for our users.
